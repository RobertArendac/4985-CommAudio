# Comm Audio Project

**Due:** To be completed by April 5. Work in groups selected in class.

**Objective:** To use all the Windows sockets programming techniques discussed in the course in the design and development of an actual product. To design and implement the “ComAudio” application.

**Assignment:**
You are required to write a Windows application which will be able to transfer sound data using the TCP/IP protocol suite to transfer audio data between two Windows workstations and play it. Your program must implement the following minimum features:

1. The initiating workstation must be able to connect to a known remote
 Server/workstation. You may select any workstation for the test.
2.  The program will have the capability to transfer and play sound on either of the two
 machines..
3.  Provide a Windows interface to your application. Options to save and retrieve sound files
 must be provided.
4. The default sound file format will be the .wav format.
5. Two-way microphone support will also be provided.
6. You are required to provide Multicasting capability with your program.
7. You are required to implement either Overlapped I/O or Completion Routine I/O.


For bonus marks you might want to consider features such as Fast Forward, Rewind, etc. For example, analyze some “Media Player” applications and see what sort of features they provide.


**To be submitted (on April 5):**

- Detailed design work showing all the implementation details of the program.
- All the components of your application (including a pre-compiled package) in separate directory. Make sure your provide a manifest file that details all of zipped package.
- A clear and concise README outlining all the different modules and components that you have submitted and how to build a functional package using them.
- A clear and concise user document on how to use your application.
- A detailed test document demonstrating the functionality of the application as per specifications.
- Peer evaluations from all team members.
- Submit a zip file containing all the code and documents as described below in the sharein folder for this course under “Final Project”.
- In addition you will be required to demonstrate the working of your program in the lab on the day the assignment is due.


**Other critical dates:**
- You are required to submit your design work for review on March 8.
- Starting March 8 and every Wednesday thereafter, each team is required to submit a written progress report. The report will outline the tasks assigned to each member, the task deadlines, all tasks accomplished to date, and tasks for the upcoming week.
